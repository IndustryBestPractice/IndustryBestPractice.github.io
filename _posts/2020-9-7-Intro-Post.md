This post won't have anything in it but a few aspirations and ideas. The blog will focus on a couple things.

1) HackTheBox.eu - We'll be doing write-ups of boxes we complete. It'll help us get better about documentation, I assure you.
2) IndustryBestPractice projects and updates, like bootsy! Bootsy is now deployed in at least 2 organizations that we know of and so far appears to be workingg great!
3) Any advice we can think of for other infosec professionals. People tend to ignore blueteam, and the write-ups for the HackTheBox should help address this gap!
